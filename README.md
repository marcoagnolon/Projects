It was asked, most of the times,  to put togheter a team in ordeer to solve the specific problem of the projects and to make a report of the job done.

Here I list the projects, programming language used and presentation the main topics of them:
Agnolon_Marco_code1.ipynb: Python, tree composition analysis of Barro Colorado island using maximum entropy approach and Metropolis algorithm, analysis of a network.

Agnolon_Marco_code2.ipynb: Python, spreading of a disease with a Gillespie-like algorithm.

Agnolon_Marco_code3.ipynb: Python, RSA and SAR on Barro Colorado island

Agnolon_Marco_ex1.pdf: report of Agnolon_Marco_code1.ipynb

Agnolon_Marco_ex2.pdf: report of Agnolon_Marco_code2.ipynb

Agnolon_Marco_ex3.pdf: report of Agnolon_Marco_code3.ipynb

PROJECT_FINAL_earthquakes.ipynb: Python, analysis of earthquakes time series with different methods.

bayesian_belief_network.ipynb: R, construction of a bayesian belief network
