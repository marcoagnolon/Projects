# Projects

In this repository there are several projects developed by me and a team of my university classmates. 
It was asked, most of the times,  to put togheter a team in ordeer to solve the specific problem of the projects and to make a report of the job done.

Here I list the projects, programming language used and presentation the main topics of them:

Agnolon_Marco_code1.ipynb: Python, trees composition analysis of Barro Colorado island using maximum entropy approach and Metropolis algorithm, analysis of a network.

Protein_Clustering_Cantor_Distance, Protein_Clustering_Damerau_Levenshtein_Distance : Python, applying the PCA clustering algorithm to the sequences associated to a certain PFAM to see whether they are connected to a taxonomic level (order, family or genus) of the proteome to which they belong or not. Each file represents the same job using two different distances between amino-acids. Finally it was used DBSCAN in order to apply another process of clustering.

Agnolon_Marco_code2.ipynb: Python, disease spreading analysis using a Gillespie-like algorithm.

Agnolon_Marco_code3.ipynb: Python, RSA and SAR on Barro Colorado island

Agnolon_Marco_ex1.pdf: report of Agnolon_Marco_code1.ipynb

Agnolon_Marco_ex2.pdf: report of Agnolon_Marco_code2.ipynb

Agnolon_Marco_ex3.pdf: report of Agnolon_Marco_code3.ipynb

Earthquake_Analysis: Python, analysis of earthquakes time series with different methods.

bayesian_belief_network.ipynb: R, construction of a bayesian belief network

Inside Neural Network repository there are some neural networks implemented using Pytorch 

ULTN contains an unsupervised learning algorithm for MNIST images reconstruction and generation using Fortran and tensor networks
